My name is Isaac Legred, and I'm currently an undergraduate majoring in physics and math and
interested in Computational Astrophsyics and Particle Astrophsyics.  Here are some things I am
interested in.
<p>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language> The Sumerian Language </a>
was the first language to be written down; today it is well studied because of the large amount
of cuneiform tablets that have been recovered from sites in Mesopotamia.  Despite this, Sumerian is
still seen as a language isolate (it has no known language relatives).  Language isolates are
ridiculously cool and demonstrate how complicated movements of people and integration of cultures
really are.  The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language> Basque </a> (Euskara)
language from northern Spain is unrelated to any of the langauges
around it; even before Roman times even Celtic languages shared a recent known ancestor with one
another.  The Romans noted that the Basque's had an unusal culture, perhaps representative of their
uncommon heritage with other people in western Europe.
